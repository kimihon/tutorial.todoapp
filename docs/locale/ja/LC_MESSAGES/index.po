"It’s a fact - Plone has a lot of complicated features. That doesn’t mean "
"Plone is hard for everything! This is a simple tutorial that anyone can "
"follow to get a simple Todo list application running inside of Plone. Would "
"you want to deploy Plone for just a Todo list in real life? Probably not. "
"You can however learn several simple, fast concepts that will get you most "
"of the way there. Feeling like you don’t understand something completely or "
"the terminology is getting to you? Sit back, relax, and finish the tutorial."
" If in the end things still aren’t clear, please give feedback and we’ll "
"look at what we could do better."
